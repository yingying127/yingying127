## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ying Ying Feng and I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I studied Architecture throughout college and fell in love with design aspect, but not with the real-life workload. I wanted to have the same creative critical thinking, and this is when I learned about coding.

I am a graduate of Fullstack Academy, a software engineering bootcamp. This bootcamp taught me JavaScript and the NERP stack(Node.js, ExpressJS, ReactJS, PostgreSQL). I also learned paired programming and the development of testing frameworks and have created a few that are pinned on my GitHub. I am an ambitious software engineer who is willing to learn!

I am interested in a career as a Software Engineer because I am passionate about creating and solving problems.  I love the challenges and creative freedom that software engineers have. I enjoy the flexibility of coding, but also following the line of rules. It allows me to think outside the box, alike architecture, to design original and innovative platforms that people can have access to.

Now, I am looking for an opportunity to bring my skills and knowledge I have learned through my career to a new team. You can view some of my projects on this GitHub profile or connect with me directly to learn more about them.

Feel free to connect with me here!
